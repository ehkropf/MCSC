General
 - Make sure help text exists in all function/class files.
 - Are there default settings, and are they adequate?
 - Write example document file.


Code cleanup
 - Change classes to have more descriptive property variables, i.e., P -> poly_domain, etc.


Development
 - implement aspect ratio limitations when plotting domains (prevent "squished" pictures)
 - make sure circledomain has copy constructor ability
 - solver and quadrature (others?) need their own options class
 - change plots to use new grey grid lines


Debugging
 - Fix bounded case when origin is on or inside a circle (via self map of unit disk).


Cleanup
 - Change objects to use the options class, including but not limited to
   - mcscmap
   - quadrature and children
   - nesolver and children
 - Putting visual monitoring in the objective functions pointed out some things that need to be handled in the super class.
